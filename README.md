## ctrl-tabs
Tired of using i3 and moving your hands all the way to your mouse
to change tabs in Firefox because the Alt+\<tab\_number\> does not work?

This add-on is for you! Now you change tabs with Ctrl+\<tab\_number\>.

New keyboard shorcuts you unlock with this add-on:

- `Ctrl+[1-9]` move to the tab number.
- `Ctrl+0` move to the last tab.
- `Ctrl+Alt+l` move to the right tab.
- `Ctrl+Alt+h` move to the left tab.
- `Ctrl+Alt+q` close the current tab.
